# CookBook

The `tidy_data.txt` file created by running the `run_analysis.R` script represents the following data specifications:

### Rows

Each row represents a sequence of averages of all features available in the `features.txt` that are an average or a standard deviation. Each row represets such average data of a single subject, performing a single activity (see `activity_labels.txt`). More information about the information generated by script in the following 'Columns' section.

The averages were calculated taking into account both testing and training data.

Given that there were 30 subjects performing 6 diferect activities during the experiment, the result in `tidy_data.txt` produces 180 rows of information.

### Columns

The first column, named "Subject", represents the subject ID, varying from 1 to 30 total subjects.

The second column, name "Activy", represents the specific activity that was performed when recording the data.

The follwing columns represent averages from already processed information made available in the data files. For example: during one session, a user with an ID = 5 might have produced 5 min of X-axis accelerometer data performing the 'WALKING'. The average and standard deviation of such data is already available. However, the same subject might have performed such activy multiple times. The result in the `tidy_data.txt` file is the means of these multiple - already processed - data.
